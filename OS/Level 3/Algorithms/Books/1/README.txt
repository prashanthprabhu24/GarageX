🧠 Why This Book?
This book was my first step into the world of algorithms.
Even though I was familiar with many of the concepts already, the intuitive and visual explanations gave me a fresh perspective.
It simplifies tough topics and makes them enjoyable, especially for beginners.

📝 Personal Notes
The book is well-suited for beginners, school students, and early undergraduates.
Focus is on intuition over complexity—it teaches how to "think algorithmically."
Doesn’t cover deep algorithmic analysis, but provides an excellent foundation.
Not enough for mastering competitive programming or research-level algorithms, but perfect as a launchpad.

Audience Group	:           Rank (out of 100)	:    Comment
General Population	        🥉 5th	               Most people don’t know algorithms.This book gives you a significant edge.
UG CS Students (B.Tech)	    ⚖️ 60th	               Matches 1st–2nd year level knowledge. Some will know more, some less.
PG CS Candidates (M.Tech)	  🧠 98th	               They usually know much more, especially in design and analysis.
PhD CS Candidates	          🧠 100th	             This is pre-school level for them. They’re doing research on complex problems.
SDE (Entry-Level)	          👨‍💻 60th	               This book covers basics needed for interviews and junior roles.
Senior SDEs	                👨‍🔧 85th	               Seniors work on scalable systems, performance, and architecture.
FAANG Lead Engineers	      🧠 100th	             Way beyond — this book would be nostalgic for them.

🛣️ What's Next?
This is just the beginning of my Algorithm journey. I'm progressing through more advanced books.
Stay tuned for those repositories.
